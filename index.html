      <p>
        Mohamed Gamasa (2008) is an Egyptian teen with a small brain and a big
        ass. Due to his small brain, it will take a long time to convince him to
        do anything, and guess what he will not do it. In his book "How to be an
        Egg," he said, "If you're walking in the street with Gamasa, expect
        anything from him. He may kick you or hit you without any reason. You'll
        be annoyed, but he'll be happy because he has completed his mission."
